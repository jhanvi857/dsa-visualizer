# 📊 DSA Visualizer

**DSA Visualizer** is a powerful and beginner-friendly web application that provides **real-time visualizations** of popular **Data Structures** and **Algorithms**. It's built to help students, developers, and interview candidates understand how various DSA concepts work through **step-by-step animations** and interactive controls.

This project is not just about coding—it’s about **learning by seeing**, making abstract ideas concrete through visual feedback.
